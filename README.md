# HalcyonFlowProject

## TODO
- Finish implementing UserRoles and the RolesDataGrid.
- Make the Index page Database-independent (but with connection testing) to allow the correct setup of the Database's connection.
- Create DataGrids, pages and a way to edit Teams.
- Plan the creation of the Projects, Tasks and Tickets environment.
- Analysis of the services and their implementation.
- Adapt to run with either a MySQL, MSSQL or SQLite database.
- (Future) Create an online-hosted database to be used by multiple users at a time.

Check the _DOCS folder for information on how to try the application. A MySQL server (local or remote) is required.
