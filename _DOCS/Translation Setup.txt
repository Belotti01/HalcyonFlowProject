Translations use the BROWSER'S LANGUAGE FROM THE USER SETTINGS.
Translation is done through Microsoft's Localization library.

[ LANGUAGE FILES ]
Translations are stored inside the Resources folder of the project;
the filenames' format for the translations is
	App.<lang>.resx
where <lang> is a 2 characters long standard identifier of the language (e.g.: en = English; it = Italian; es = Spanish etc.)
for more specific localization one could use the <lang>.<location> format, like en-US or en-EN.

The format for each resource is:
NAME:	The ENGLISH word or phrase
VALUE:	The translation of the word or phrase
e.g. in App.it.resx:
	NAME: Hello
	VALUE: Ciao

[ TRANSLATION ]
The IStringLocalizer<App> object is instantiated through dependency injection, so it can be accessed through injection.
This is already setup inside BaseComponent.cs, so always remember to inherit it.
To translate from a Razor component, simply invoke the @Translate(string text) method, and write the text in english.
